=== OVERVIEW ===

Greenland Neutrino Observatory Simulator (GNOSim)

=== USAGE EXAMPLES ===

Fast-track to running simulations. Follow these steps:

1. Precompute ray-tracing libraries
   gnosim/trace/refraction_library.py

   This will create a folder containing multiple traces through the ice corresponding
   to different elevation angles at the antenna. The RefractionLibrary class manages
   the output trace files. Need to regenerate trace libraries for different antenna
   elevations, index of refraction profiles, attenuation lengths, etc.

2. Set detector configuration
   gnosim/sim/config_simple_-2.py (example)

   Currently very simplistic, single station with single antenna.

3. Run simulations
   a. One scenario at a time:
      gnosim/sim/sim.py

   b. Multiple scenarios simultaneously on compute farm:
      gnosim/sim/farm.py

      Currently only syntax appropriate to Midway cluster at UChicago.
