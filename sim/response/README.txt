I was sent these files from Dan Smith, who was working on pulsed data for ARA. 
He obtained this info from that data.  Here is his description from the email:

"
Attached is the current antenna / electronic chain response. I saved them in 
numpy data format (npy) and included a quick script on how to load and it and 
convert it to time domain.  Important to note that frequencies above ~750 and 
below ~150 MHz are aphysical (system couldn't actually read them) and the values 
that are in those ranges exist just to make the signal causal. I am not sure how 
you should deal with that in your simulation, just wanted to let you know.
